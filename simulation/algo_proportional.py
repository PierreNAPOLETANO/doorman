# Implements the "ProportionalShare" algorithm, where every client gets
# what it wants, except when the sum of wants is larger than the available
# capacity, in which case everybody gets a proportion of their request.
# A potential problem is when one client asks for a million billion,
# which means that it will get all capacity and all the other clients get
# next to nothing. The FairShare algorithm solves this.
